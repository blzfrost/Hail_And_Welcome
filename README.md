# Hail_And_Welcome

If you're reading this you've found my secret lair. Congrats.
If you can brave the snakes, there's coffee waiting. 

I'm currently in school for CyberSecurity. 
I enjoyed making a couple little games in pycharm.
Mostly by following tutorials and then branching off to make it my own.

I'm still getting used to github, but hope to start adding more content here.
